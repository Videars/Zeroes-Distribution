# Zeroes-Distribution
Zeroes Distribution of Quadratic Equations  

Statistical study of the zeroes distribution of quadratic equations as the vary of coefficients.  

I wanted to unterstand what's the probability that a quadratic equation with random real coefficient has real zeroes and what is the distribution of these zeroes.  

The code generates N quadratic equations, calculates the delta to verify the existence of real zeroes and determines their values.  
It then calculates statistical valuable information on the data obtained.
